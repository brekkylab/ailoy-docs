# Agent Response Format

**Agent responses** are the streamed output of the agent runs. Since Ailoy is
designed to stream output on-the-fly, each part of the response can be treated
as a real-time output.

Basically, an agent response has the following structure:

```python
{
  type: One of ["output_text" | "tool_call" | "tool_call_result" | "reasoning" | "error"]
  role: One of ["assistant" | "tool"];
  end_of_turn: boolean
  content: Depends on type;
}
```

- The `type` field indicates what kind of output the agent is currently
  producing. Depending on the type, the structure of the response may vary.
- The `role` field specifies who is speakingâ€”either the Assistant (LLM model) or
  a Tool.
- The `end_of_turn` flag indicates whether this response is the final message
  for the current turn. If set to `true`, it means a new type of response will
  follow.

Here are the descriptions of each response type:

- **output_text**: This is the main textual output from the assistant. The
  `content` field contains a string with the generated text.
- **tool_call**: A message indicating that the assistant is requesting a tool to
  be invoked. Within the agent system, tools automatically receive this call and
  are expected to return a corresponding `tool_call_result`. The `content`
  contains a JSON-compatible dictionary describing the tool call.
- **tool_call_result**: The result returned by the tool in response to a
  `tool_call`. The assistant receives this result and uses it to produce a final
  response to the user. The `content` contains a JSON-compatible dictionary with
  the tool's output.
- **reasoning**: Intermediate reasoning steps produced by a reasoning-enabled
  model. The `content` field contains a string with the generated reasoning. If
  the `ignore_reasoning_messages` flag is enabled, these messages are omitted
  from the output.
- **error**: Indicates that an error has occurred. `content` field contains the
  reason of the error. After error raised, no more responses will be generated.

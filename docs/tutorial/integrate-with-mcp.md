# Integrate with MCP

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol developed by Anthropic to standardize how language models interact with external systemsâ€”such as tools, memory backends, and context managers. MCP enables structured, dynamic communication between an LLM and its environment, empowering models to access external tools, retrieve real-time information, and perform complex, multi-step reasoning.

### Using MCP with Ailoy

Ailoy Agents can seamlessly integrate with existing MCP-compliant servers. For example, the following code connects to the official GitHub MCP server:

```python
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

agent.add_tools_from_mcp_server(
    StdioServerParameters(
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    )
)
```

This launches the GitHub MCP server as a subprocess using standard I/O for communication. The agent automatically discovers the tools exposed by the server and registers them into its internal toolset.

### Querying via MCP Tools

Once the tools are registered, the agent can invoke them naturally through its `query()` method:

```python
question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
for resp in agent.query(question):
    print(resp.content, end='')
print()
```

This demonstrates how the agent utilizes the GitHub MCP tools to search repositories and summarize their contents.

### Complete Example

Here is the full source code to set up an agent, connect it to the GitHub MCP server, and issue a query:

```python
from ailoy import AsyncRuntime, Agent
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

rt = Runtime()
with Agent(rt, model_name="qwen3-8b") as agent:
    # Add tools from Github MCP server
    agent.add_tools_from_mcp_server(
        StdioServerParameters(
            command="npx",
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
        )
    )

    question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
    for resp in agent.run(question):
        print(resp.content, end='')
    print()
```

> **Note**: This example assumes that Node.js and the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` package are available in your environment.

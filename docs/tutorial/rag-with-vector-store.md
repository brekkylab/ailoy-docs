# RAG with Vector Store

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with language generation. Instead of relying solely on the model’s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant documents from an external source (like a vector database) and feeds them into the language model. This allows the model to generate responses that are more accurate, up-to-date, and grounded in factual content.

RAG is especially useful in scenarios where the knowledge base is too large to fit into the model’s context window, or when up-to-date domain-specific information is needed. It bridges the gap between static model training and dynamic, real-world queries by incorporating relevant context at inference time.

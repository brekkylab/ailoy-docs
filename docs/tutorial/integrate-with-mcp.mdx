# Integrate with MCP

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol developed by Anthropic
to standardize how language models interact with external systemsâ€”such as tools,
memory backends, and context managers. MCP enables structured, dynamic
communication between an LLM and its environment, empowering models to access
external tools, retrieve real-time information, and perform complex, multi-step
reasoning.

### Using MCP with Ailoy

Ailoy Agents can seamlessly integrate with existing MCP-compliant servers. For
example, the following code connects to the official GitHub MCP server:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

agent.add_tools_from_mcp_server(
    StdioServerParameters(
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    )
)
```

```typescript
await agent.addToolsFromMcpServer({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
});
```

</CodeTabs>

This launches the GitHub MCP server as a subprocess using standard I/O for
communication. The agent automatically discovers the tools exposed by the server
and registers them into its internal toolset.

### Querying via MCP Tools

Once the tools are registered, the agent can invoke them as needed when you 
call the query() method:

<CodeTabs>

```python
question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
for resp in agent.query(question):
    print(resp.content, end='')
print()
```

```typescript
const question =
  "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
  process.stdout.write(`${resp.content}`);
}
process.stdout.write("\n");
```

</CodeTabs>

This demonstrates how the agent utilizes the GitHub MCP tools to search
repositories and summarize their contents.

### Complete Example

Here is the full source code to set up an agent, connect it to the GitHub MCP
server, and issue a query:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from ailoy import Runtime, Agent
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

rt = Runtime()
with Agent(rt, model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-8B") as agent:
    # Add tools from Github MCP server
    agent.add_tools_from_mcp_server(
        StdioServerParameters(
            command="npx",
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
        )
    )

    question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
    for resp in agent.run(question):
        print(resp.content, end='')
    print()
```

```typescript
import { startRuntime, createAgent } from "ailoy-node";

(async () => {
  const rt = await startRuntime();
  const agent = await createAgent(rt, { model: { name: "Qwen/Qwen3-8B" } });

  // Add tools from Github MCP server
  await agent.addToolsFromMcpServer({
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  });

  const question =
    "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
  for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
    process.stdout.write(`${resp.content}`);
  }
  process.stdout.write("\n");
})();
```

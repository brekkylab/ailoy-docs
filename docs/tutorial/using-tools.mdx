# Using Tools

One of the most powerful features in Ailoy is the tool calling system. It allows you to extend the capabilities of your LLM by connecting it to external tools or APIs. This way, the agent can access real-time or domain-specific information, even if it wasn’t part of the model’s training data.

For example, you can attach weather or location services to your agent. You could also build a financial decision-making app using real-time exchange rates or stock prices. Moreover, the agent can execute financial decisions itself with LLM, enabling powerful automation.

## How Tool Calling Works

Let's take a quick look at how tool calling works in general. In most agent
system, tool calling can be achieved by the following process.

<p align="center">
  <ToolStructureSvg style={{ width: "40%", height: "40%" }} />
</p>

1. **\[Tool Description\]** Assistant (or LLM) can recognize a tool based on its
  description.
2. **\[User Query\]** User provides an input prompt to the assistant.
3. **\[Tool Call\]** If that query is related to a tool, assistant
  can invoke the tool through a specified format.
4. **\[Tool Result\]** Tool performs its task as invoked and returns the result.
5. **\[Assistant Response\]** Assistant can incorporate the tool's output to produce a more accurate
  answer.

## Building an Agent with Tool Support

Now, let's see how to make a ***tool-aware agent*** in Ailoy.

### How to add tools from presets

In this example, we’ll use the **[Frankfurter API](https://frankfurter.dev/)** to add functionality to lookup real-time currency exchange rates into your `Agent`.

The Frankfurter API tool is already defined as ***preset*** and included in the library along with the other useful tools. So you just can call `add_tools_from_preset()` with the tool name to attach the tool into the `Agent`.

Some presets can contain multiple tools which work together.

<CodeTabs>

```python
agent.add_tools_from_preset("frankfurter")
```

```typescript
agent.addToolsFromPreset("frankfurter");
```

</CodeTabs>

### How to notice tool calls

You can find out what tool the agent invoked and what result it produced through the response generated by `agent.query()`.  
The `type` field included in the response shows what type of response it is, and the `content` field has the content regardless of the type.

For more information on response format, refer to the **[Agent Response Format](/docs/concepts/agent-response-format)** document.

<CodeTabs>

```python
for resp in agent.query(question):
  # skip printing when the response is related to tool calls
  if resp.type in ("tool_call", "tool_call_result"):
    continue
  print(resp.content, end='')
```

```typescript
for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
  // skip printing when the response is related to tool calls
  if (resp.type in ["tool_call", "tool_call_result"])
    continue
  process.stdout.write(resp.content);
}
```

</CodeTabs>


### Example code
Let's see the entire example code using the Frankfurter API tool.

<CodeTabs>

```python
from ailoy import Runtime, Agent

rt = Runtime()

with Agent(rt, model_name="qwen3-8b") as agent:
  # Attach frankfurter's API
  agent.add_tools_from_preset("frankfurter")

  question = "I want to buy 250 U.S. Dollar and 350 Chinese Yuan with my Korean Won. How much do I need to take?"
  print(f"Question: {question}\n")
  for resp in agent.query(question):
    if resp.type == "output_text":
      print(resp.content, end='')
    elif resp.type == "tool_call":
      tool_name = resp.content.function.name
      tool_arguments = resp.content.function.arguments
      print(f"Tool call: {tool_name}({', '.join(f'{k}="{v}"' for k, v in tool_arguments.items())})\n")
    elif resp.type == "tool_call_result":
      tool_result = resp.content
      print(f"Tool result: {tool_result.content}\n")
    else:
      raise TypeError("Unexpected response type.")
  print()

rt.stop()
```

```typescript
import { startRuntime, defineAgent } from "ailoy-node";

(async () => {
  const rt = await startRuntime();

  const agent = await defineAgent(rt, "qwen3-8b");

  // Attach frankfurter's API
  agent.addToolsFromPreset("frankfurter");

  const question = "I want to buy 250 U.S. Dollar and 350 Chinese Yuan with my Korean Won. How much do I need to take?";
  console.log(`Question: ${question}\n`);
  for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
    if (resp.type === "output_text") {
      process.stdout.write(resp.content);
    } else if (resp.type === "tool_call") {
      const toolName = resp.content.function.name;
      const toolArguments = resp.content.function.arguments;
      const argString = Object.entries(toolArguments).map(([k, v]) => `${k}="${v}"`).join(", ");
      console.log(`Tool call: ${toolName}(${argString})\n`);
    } else if (resp.type === "tool_call_result") {
      const toolResult = resp.content;
      console.log(`Tool result: ${toolResult.content}\n`);
    } else {
      throw new TypeError("Unexpected response type.");
    }
  }

  console.log();

  await agent.delete();

  await rt.stop();
})();
```

</CodeTabs>

You can see that the agent uses the Frankfurter API to incorporate real-time exchange rate information into its response.

Here's what the output will look like:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<TerminalBox>
{`Question: I want to buy 250 U.S. Dollar and 350 Chinese Yuan with my Korean Won. How much do I need to take?

Tool call: frankfurter(symbols="USD,CNY", base="KRW")

Tool result: {"CNY": 0.00518, "USD": 0.00072}

To buy 250 U.S. Dollars (USD) and 350 Chinese Yuan (CNY) using Korean Won (KRW), you need to calculate the total amount of KRW required based on the exchange rates:

- **1 USD = 0.00072 KRW**
- **1 CNY = 0.00518 KRW**

### Calculation:
- **For USD**:  
  $ 250 \\, \\text{USD} \\times \\frac{1}{0.00072} = 250 \\times 1388.89 = 347,222.22 \\, \\text{KRW} $

- **For CNY**:  
  $ 350 \\, \\text{CNY} \\times \\frac{1}{0.00518} = 350 \\times 193.18 = 67,613.39 \\, \\text{KRW} $

### Total:
- **KRW needed**: $ 347,222.22 + 67,613.39 = 414,835.61 \\, \\text{KRW} $

You will need approximately **414,835.61 KRW** to buy 250 USD and 350 CNY.`}

Keep in mind: Tools aren't free — every token counts.

Using many tools can generate a large amount of information for the AI to process, potentially leading to longer context lengths and decreased performance.

Whether you're running AI through external APIs or using on-device models, it consumes resources.
API usage can lead to unexpectedly high bills, while on-device AI may slow down your machine or even cause it to crash.
Whether you're using external APIs or running models on-device, resources are consumed. API usage might result in unexpectedly high costs, while on-device models could slow down your machine or even cause it to crash.

Avoid using unnecessary tools. Keep your chat context focused and concise.

## Defining Your Own Tool

If the tool you are looking for doesn't exist, or you want more fine-grained control, you can define your own tool through the simple APIs of Ailoy.

The following example shows how to explicitly define the Frankfurter API tool we saw above.

<CodeTabs>

```python
rt = Runtime()
agent = Agent(rt, model_name="qwen3-8b")

frankfurter = {
  "type": "restapi",
  "description": {
    "name": "frankfurter",
    "description": "Get the latest currency exchange rates of target currencies based on the 'base' currency",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "base": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The ISO 4217 currency code to be the divider of the currency rate to be got."
        },
        "symbols": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The target ISO 4217 currency codes separated by comma."
        }
      },
    }
  },
  "behavior": {
    "baseURL": "https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": {
      "accept": "application/json"
    },
    "outputPath": "rates"
  },
}
agent.add_restapi_tool(frankfurter)
```

```typescript
const rt = await startRuntime();
const agent = await defineAgent(rt, "qwen3-8b");

const frankfurter = {
  type: "restapi",
  description: {
    name: "frankfurter",
    description:
      "Get the latest currency exchange rates of target currencies based on the 'base' currency",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        base: {
          type: "string",
          description:
            "The ISO 4217 currency code to be the divider of the currency rate to be got.",
        },
        symbols: {
          type: "string",
          description: "The target ISO 4217 currency codes separated by comma.",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  behavior: {
    baseURL: "https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest",
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      accept: "application/json",
    },
    outputPath: "rates",
  },
};
agent.addRESTAPITool(frankfurter);
```

</CodeTabs>

The `description` defines how the AI recognizes and understands the tool, while the `behavior` field specifies what should happen when the AI attempts to execute the tool.  
The format of the `description` is identical to the format widely used for defining tools in LLM, which is a JSON Schema explaining a function signature.  
And the format of the `behavior` depends on its type, naturally. Since we are using a REST API tool In this example, the behavior includes the API’s URL, HTTP method, and headers.

# Using Tools

One of the most powerful features in Ailoy is the tool calling system. It allows
you to extend the capabilities of your LLM by connecting it to external tools or
APIs. This way, the agent can access real-time or domain-specific information,
even if it wasn’t part of the model’s training data. For example, you can attach
weather or location services to your agent. You could also build a financial
decision-making app using real-time exchange rates or stock prices. Moreover,
the agent can execute financial decisions itself with LLM, enabling powerful
automation.

## How tool calling works

Let's take a quick look at how tool calling works in general. In most agent
system, tool calling can be achieved by the following process.

<ToolStructureSvg style={{ width: "40%", height: "40%" }} />

- (1) \[Tool Description\] Assistant (or LLM) can recognize a tool based on its
  description (at it’s initialization).
- (2) User provides an input prompt to the assistant.
- (3) \[Tool Call\] If the user's question is related to a tool, the assistant
  can invoke the tool using the specified format.
- (4) \[Tool Result\] Tool performs its task and returns a response.
- (5) Assistant can incorporate the tool's output to produce a more accurate
  answer.

## Building an Agent with Tool Support

Now, let's see how to make an agent tool-aware in Ailoy. In this example, we’ll
use the [Frankfurter API](https://frankfurter.dev/) to add real-time exchange
rate lookup functionality.

The first step is to define a tool.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem {...pythonTab}>

```python showLineNumbers
rt = Runtime()
agent = Agent(rt, model_name="qwen3-8b")

frankfurter = {
  "type": "restapi",
  "description": {
    "name": "frankfurter",
    "description": "Get the latest currency exchange rates of target currencies based on the 'base' currency",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "base": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The ISO 4217 currency code to be the divider of the currency rate to be got."
            },
            "symbols": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The target ISO 4217 currency codes separated by comma."
            }
        },
    }
  },
  "behavior": {
    "baseURL": "https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": {
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
  },
}
agent.add_restapi_tool(frankfurter)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem {...nodeTab}>

```typescript showLineNumbers
const rt = await startRuntime();
const agent = await defineAgent(rt, { model: { name: "qwen3-8b" } });

const frankfurter = {
  type: "restapi",
  description: {
    name: "frankfurter",
    description:
      "Get the latest currency exchange rates of target currencies based on the 'base' currency",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        base: {
          type: "string",
          description:
            "The ISO 4217 currency code to be the divider of the currency rate to be got.",
        },
        symbols: {
          type: "string",
          description: "The target ISO 4217 currency codes separated by comma.",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  behavior: {
    baseURL: "https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest",
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      accept: "application/json",
    },
  },
};
agent.add_restapi_tool(frankfurter);
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `description` defines how the AI recognizes and understands the tool. In
contrast, the `behavior` field specifies what should happen when the AI attempts
to execute the tool. Naturally, the format of the `behavior` depends on its
type. In this example, since we are using a REST API tool, the behavior includes
the API’s URL, HTTP method, and headers.

For the ease of implementation, Ailoy provides presets for several commonly used
tools, including the Frankfurter API.

If you find a proper tool from preset, you can simply imports it into the agent:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem {...pythonTab}>

```python
agent.add_tools_from_preset("frankfurter")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem {...nodeTab}>

```typescript
agent.addToolsFromPreset("frankfurter");
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>

By calling `run` function, you can see that the agent uses the Frankfurters API
to incorporate real-time exchange rate information into its response.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem {...pythonTab}>

```python showLineNumbers
question = "I want to buy 250 U.S. Dollar and 350 Chinese Yuan with my Korean Won. How much do I need to take?"
async for resp in agent.run(question):
    print(resp.content, end='')
print()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem {...nodeTab}>

```typescript showLineNumbers
const question = "I want to buy 250 U.S. Dollar and 350 Chinese Yuan with my Korean Won. How much do I need to take?";
for await (const resp in agent.run(question)) {
    process.stdout.write(resp.content);
}
process.stdout.write("\n");
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Here's what the output will look like:

<TerminalBox>
{`
id='call_fe4b76ff-021c-409b-a835-df83b425f35e' type='function' function=ToolCallFunction(name='frankfurter', arguments={'symbols': 'USD,CNY', 'base': 'KRW'})role='tool' name='frankfurter' tool_call_id='call_fe4b76ff-021c-409b-a835-df83b425f35e' content='{"CNY": 0.00516, "USD": 0.00072}'To buy 250 U.S. Dollars (USD) and 350 Chinese Yuan (CNY) using Korean Won (KRW), you need to calculate the total amount of KRW required based on the exchange rates:

- **1 USD = 0.00072 KRW**
- **1 CNY = 0.00516 KRW**

### Step 1: Calculate KRW for USD
$$ 250 \, \text{USD} \times \frac{1}{0.00072} = 250 \, \text{USD} \times 1388.89 \approx 347,222 \, \text{KRW} $$

### Step 2: Calculate KRW for CNY
$$ 350 \, \text{CNY} \times \frac{1}{0.00516} = 350 \, \text{CNY} \times 193.88 \approx 67,858 \, \text{KRW} $$

### Step 3: Add both amounts
$$ 347,222 \, \text{KRW} + 67,858 \, \text{KRW} = 415,080 \, \text{KRW} $$

### Final Answer:
You need approximately **415,080 Korean Won** to buy 250 USD and 350 CNY.

:::warning
Tools aren't free — every token counts.

Using many tools can generate a large amount of information for the AI to process, resulting in longer context lengths.

Whether you're running AI through external APIs or using on-device models, it consumes resources.
API usage can lead to unexpectedly high bills, while on-device AI may slow down your machine or even cause it to crash.

Avoid using unnecessary tools. Keep your chat context focused and concise.

# Reasoning

Reasoning is an advanced capability of AI that enables it to tackle complex
tasks through explicit, step-by-step logical inference. Reasoning models break
down problems into smaller sub-tasks rather than solving them in a single pass.
Compared to direct answer generation, it offers two key advantages:

1. Improved problem-solving intelligence
2. Transparent and traceable intermediate reasoning steps

This functionality is particularly well-suited for domains that require
multi-step reasoning, such as scientific analysis, legal interpretation, or
strategic decision-making. However, since the reasoning step needs additional
computation and memory usage, it can increase latency and overall resource
consumption. Therefore, itâ€™s important to enable reasoning only when necessary,
based on the complexity of your use case.

In Ailoy, You can activate it by simply specifying an option:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem {...pythonTab}>

```python showLineNumbers
async for resp in agent.run(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  enable_reasoning=True
):
  print(resp.content, end='')
print()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem {...nodeTab}>

```typescript showLineNumbers
for await (const resp of agent.run(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  {
    enableReasoning: true,
  }
)) {
  process.stdout.write(resp.content);
}
process.stdout.write("\n");
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Since reasoning is an internal process, you may not want to include it in the
output. In such cases, you can use the `ignore_reasoning` option to exclude it
from the output.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem {...pythonTab}>

```python showLineNumbers
async for resp in agent.run(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  enable_reasoning=True,
  ignore_reasoning_messages=True
):
  print(resp.content, end='')
print()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem {...nodeTab}>

```typescript showLineNumbers
for await (const resp of agent.run(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  {
    enableReasoning: true,
    ignoreReasoningMessages: true,
  }
)) {
  process.stdout.write(resp.content);
}
process.stdout.write("\n");
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Note: Qwen3-0.6b is too small to perform effective reasoning.
We recommend using a model with bigger parameters for reasoning tasks.

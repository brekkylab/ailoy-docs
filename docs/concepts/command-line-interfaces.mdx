# Command Line Interfaces

Ailoy includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to manage
resources used within the Ailoy ecosystem. The CLI is installed alongside the
Ailoy package in both Python and Node.js environments.

Once you've completed the installation, you can run the `ailoy` command. Run
`ailoy --help` for more details.

#### `ailoy model list`

Lists all available models in the local cache directory.

#### `ailoy model download <model-id>`

You'll be prompted to confirm the deletion by entering `Y`(`y`) or `N`(`n`).

# Architecture

## Message Broker

Ailoy aims to enable production-level LLM execution with minimal boilerplate across a wide range of programming languages and environments.
To achieve this, Ailoy is structured around a modular, message-driven architecture composed of three core components: **Runtime**, **Broker**, and **VM**.
It is architected with the aim of achieving flexibility, portability, and performance.

### Runtime

The `Runtime` serves as the user-facing interface for a specific programming language.
It defines the public API and manages all interactions between the user and the internal components of the system.

#### Responsibilities

- Expose user-facing APIs
- Serialize user requests into messages
- Deserialize responses back into native objects

#### Implementations

- Python
- JavaScript (node.js)
- *JavaScript (browser) (planned)*
- *Java / Kotlin (planned)*
- *C# (planned)*
- etc.

### Broker

The `Broker` handles message delivery, routing, and protocol abstraction.
It sits between the `Runtime` and the `VM`, managing communications and message dispatching.

#### Responsibilities

- Manage connections and message queues
- Route messages to appropriate VMs
- Support multiple networking backends

#### Implementations

- inproc (for intra-device protocol)
- *tcp (for inter-device protocol) (planned)*

### VM (Virtual Machine)

The `VM` is the execution backend that performs the actual compute tasks.
It is platform-specific and executes requests routed through the `Broker`.

#### Responsibilities

- Execute AI-related tasks or compute operations
- Serialize response messages and return them to the `Broker`

#### Target architectures

Our goal is to run the `VM` across diverse environments.
To support this, we are implementing portable `VM` backends across a variety of targets.

- x86_64-windows-unknown
- arm64-macos-unknown
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- *wasm32-emscripten-unknown (planned)*
- to be added

All communication with the `VM` is strictly mediated through the Broker.

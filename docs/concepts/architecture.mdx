# Architecture

## In a Nutshell

Ailoy aims to enable performant LLM execution with minimal boilerplate across a wide range of programming languages and environments.
To achieve this, it is structured around a modular, message-driven architecture composed of three core components: **Runtime**, **Broker**, and **VM**.

### Runtime

The `Runtime` serves as the user-facing interface.
It defines the public API and manages all interactions between the user and the internal components of the system.

To ensure seamless integration across diverse development environments, each `Runtime` is designed to follow the idiomatic conventions and best practices of its target programming language.
This allows developers to interact with Ailoy in a way that feels natural and intuitive, without having to inspect an internal architecture.

#### Responsibilities

- Expose user-facing APIs
- Serialize user requests into messages
- Deserialize responses back into native objects

#### Implementations

- Python
- JavaScript (node.js)
- *JavaScript (browser) (planned)*
- *Java / Kotlin (planned)*
- *C# (planned)*
- etc.

### Broker

The Broker implements Ailoy’s internal message broker system.
It sits between the Runtime and the VM, managing communication and dispatching messages between them.

Ailoy currently uses an in-process communication model for minimal overhead and maximum performance.
This implementation is based on a local network system, allowing fast and efficient message delivery between components within the same device.
However, the underlying architecture is designed to be easily extended to support remote communication protocols, such as TCP, enabling cross-machine scenarios.

#### Responsibilities

- Manage connections and message queues
- Route messages to appropriate VMs
- Support multiple networking backends

#### Implementations

- inproc (for intra-device protocol)
- *tcp (for inter-device protocol) (planned)*

### VM

The `VM` is the execution backend that performs the actual compute tasks.
It is platform-specific and executes requests routed through the `Broker`.

#### Responsibilities

- Execute AI-related tasks or compute operations
- Serialize response messages and return them to the `Broker`

#### Target architectures

Our goal is to run the `VM` across diverse environments.
To support this, we are implementing portable `VM` backends across a variety of targets.

- x86_64-windows-unknown
- arm64-macos-unknown
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- *wasm32-emscripten-unknown (planned)*
- to be added

## Module System

In Ailoy's architecture, the VM is responsible for computing and returning results for incoming requests.
It must be capable of executing a wide range of functions, including LLM inference, deep learning modules, and various utility operations.
The number of functions supported by the VM is expected to grow continuously as new capabilities are introduced.
Additionally, the VM should support user-defined tasks as plug-ins, enabling developers to extend its functionality without modifying the core library.
These two requirements—supporting a growing set of functions and enabling extensibility through plug-ins—are fundamental to the design of the VM.

To address these requirements, Ailoy adopts a module-based VM system.
This design allows the VM to dynamically load task-specific modules and invoke the functions defined within them.
Conceptually, a `Module` can be thought of as a package, similar to those found in many modern programming languages.

| **Entity** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **VM** | The runtime environment where task execution takes place |
| **Module** | The executable logic that defines how tasks are performed within the VM |

Each module consists of two types of sub-entities: operators and components.
An operator is a stateless function that executes immediately when invoked with input and returns a result.
In contrast, a component is a stateful instance that produces an output based on both its internal state and the given input.
Roughly speaking, operators are analogous to functions, while components resemble class instances in traditional programming.

| **Entity** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Operator** | A stateless function. Takes input and returns a result. |
| **Component Type** | A class-like definition that can be instantiated by VM when it imports a module. |
| **Component** | A runtime instance. Maintains internal state and produces output based on input and it's state. |

Conceptually, a module can be thought of as a package, similar to those found in many modern programming languages.
Each module consists of two types of sub-entities: operators and component types (also referred to as component factories).
Some may wonder why a module consists of component types instead of just components.
In Ailoy, components are not instantiated at module load time; rather, they are explicitly created by the user by sending a define_component-type packet.
It is analogous to how packages work in most programming languages—when a package is imported, it typically exposes class definitions rather than class instances, and provides access to their constructors so that users can instantiate them as needed.
